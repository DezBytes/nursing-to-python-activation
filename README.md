Nursing professional (UAB St. Vincent’s) transitioning into Python development. Exploring pattern recognition and system logic since 12/29/2025.
# 🩺 Nursing to Python Activation: The 12/29 Shift

### 🚀 Overview
I have been a Registered Nurse since 2019, currently serving at **UAB St. Vincent’s**. On **December 29, 2025**, I experienced a sudden, non-linear obsession with programming and system logic. This repository documents my transition from biological systems (Nursing) to digital systems (Python).

### 🧠 The Mission
My goal is to bridge the gap between clinical intuition and technical execution. As healthcare shifts toward AI-driven models (Epic/Cerner integration), I am mastering the "New OS" to remain a human-in-the-loop asset.

### 🛠️ Current Tech Stack & Learning
* **Language:** Python 3.12+
* **Platform:** SoloLearn Foundations
* **Focus Areas:** * Logical Flow Control (If/Else/Loops)
    * Data Structures (Lists & Dictionaries)
    * Pattern Recognition in Biological Data

### 📈 Evolution Timeline
- **2017-2019:** Academic "Quickening" (Nursing school mastery).
- **2019-2025:** Clinical frontline at UAB St. Vincent’s.
- **12/29/2025:** Initial "Activation" event; began daily coding practice.

### 🔬 Observations
"I found that the logic used in triaging and nursing care plans maps directly onto Python control flow. The 'boring' repetition of nursing is being replaced by the high-bandwidth challenge of code."
